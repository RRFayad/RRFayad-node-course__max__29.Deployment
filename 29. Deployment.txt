448. Module Introduction
    - Preparing for Deployment
    - Steps & Config
    - Security

449. Deploying Different Kinds of Apps
    - Server-Side Rendered Views
        HTML
        Templating Engines

    - API's
        Rest
        GraphQL

450. Deployment Preparations

    - Environment Variable

    - Use Production API Keys
        - Instead of testing / development API key
    

    - Reduce Error Output Details to Users
        - Don't send sensitive info to users

    - Set Secure Response Headers
        - Best Practices

    - Add Asset Compression
        - Reduce Response Size
    
    - Configure Logging
        - To stay up to date about what's hapenning

    - Use SSL/TLS
        - Encryp data

451. Using Environment Variables

    - Max showed ow to set up and create the env variables;
        - He showd on the package.json file

    - For the port:
        process.env.PORT || 3000

453. Setting Secure Response Headers with Helmet

    - npm install helmet

    - Just set it as the 1s middleware

    - It just add some secure headers to the application

454. Compressing Assets

    - npm install compression

    - const compression = require("compression");

    - app.use(compression())
        * Just after the helmet

    - It makes everything lighter

455. Setting Up Request Logging

    * It will create a document for controlling all the logs (usually it won't be needed)
    - npm install morgan
    
    -const morgan = require("morgan");

    - const accessLogStream = fs.createWriteStream(
        path.join(__dirname, "access.log"),
        { flags: "a" } // a stand for append (which means the logs will be appended)
    );

    app.use(morgan("combined", { stream: accessLogStream }));
